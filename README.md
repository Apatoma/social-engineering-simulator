# 🎭 Social Engineering Simulator

Welcome to the **Social Engineering Simulator**! This application is designed to simulate social engineering attacks, such as phishing attempts, for ethical hacking purposes. Using AI, the simulator helps train users to recognize and respond to such threats, enhancing their ability to identify and handle potential security risks.

## ✨ Features

- 🤖 **AI-Driven Simulation**: Simulates social engineering attacks, including phishing, using AI to generate realistic scenarios.
- 🔍 **Phishing Detection Training**: Provides a platform to practice recognizing and responding to phishing attempts.
- 📊 **Interactive Training**: Allows users to input potential phishing content and see how the AI responds.
- 🛠️ **Customizable Scenarios**: Adapt and customize scenarios to better fit different training needs.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

**Backend**:
- 🐍 **Python**
- 🛠️ **Flask** (for handling web requests)
- 🧠 **AI Engine** (for simulating social engineering attacks)

**Frontend**:
- 📑 **HTML/CSS** (for the user interface)

**Database**:
- Not required (currently no database integration)

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Apatoma/social-engineering-simulator.git
    cd social-engineering-simulator
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (Optional but recommended)**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    python -m flask run
    ```
    The application should now be running at [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000).

## 📝 Usage

- **Open the application**: Navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000) in your web browser.
- **Enter Suspicious Content**: Input any text that might represent a suspicious message or potential phishing content.
- **Simulate Response**: The AI will generate a response based on the input, simulating a social engineering attack.

## 🛤️ Future Enhancements

- 🤖 **Enhanced AI**: Integrate more sophisticated AI models for analyzing and generating social engineering attacks using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
- 👥 **User Management**: Implement a database to store user interactions, simulate attacks on a per-user basis, and provide detailed reports on user vulnerabilities.
- 📧 **Real-World Integration**: Add email or messaging API integration to simulate real-world phishing attempts in a controlled environment.
- 🛠️ **Custom Scenarios**: Allow administrators to create custom scenarios for training purposes, adjusting the difficulty and nature of the simulated attacks.
